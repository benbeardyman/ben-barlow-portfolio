        description: "As a team we practised Agile ways of working to run our project. We mainly employed Mob programming to create this web application that allows users to create bucket and visited lists, pulling data via an API and saving to a database. In particular I steered the team towards this brief so we could incorporate as many of the skills we had learned in the module as possible. The front-end was built in JavaScript utilising React writing data to a MongoDB database using the Express framework. This was an incredibly fun project and the experience of Mobbing has opened up my perspective on collaborative programming.",
